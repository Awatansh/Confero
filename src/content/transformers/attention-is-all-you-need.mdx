# Attention is All You Need

The transformer architecture, introduced in 2017, fundamentally changed how we approach sequence-to-sequence tasks.

## The Problem with RNNs

Before transformers, RNNs and LSTMs were the standard for processing sequences. However, they had limitations:

- **Sequential processing** - Can't parallelize computation
- **Long-range dependencies** - Information can get lost
- **Slow training** - Processing must be sequential

## Enter: Self-Attention

Self-attention allows each position in a sequence to directly attend to all other positions. The mechanism works by:

1. Computing a **Query** for each position
2. Comparing it with all **Keys** in the sequence
3. Computing attention weights
4. Combining the **Values** weighted by these scores

Key components:

- **Query (Q)** - What am I looking for?
- **Key (K)** - What is each position about?
- **Value (V)** - What should I return?
- **d_k** - Dimension of keys

## Multi-Head Attention

Multiple attention heads allow the model to:

- Attend to different parts of the input simultaneously
- Focus on different representation subspaces
- Capture diverse types of relationships

Each head learns different attention patterns independently, then concatenated together.

## Advantages of Transformers

✓ **Parallelization** - All positions can be processed simultaneously
✓ **Long-range dependencies** - Direct connections between all tokens
✓ **Scalability** - Efficiently scales to large datasets
✓ **Transfer learning** - Pre-trained models can be fine-tuned

This architecture became the foundation for GPT, BERT, and modern LLMs!
