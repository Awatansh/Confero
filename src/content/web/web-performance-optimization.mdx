# Web Performance Optimization

Speed matters. Users expect web applications to load quickly and respond instantly.

## Core Web Vitals

Google's Core Web Vitals measure real-world user experience:

### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

- How quickly the main content loads
- Target: < 2.5 seconds

### First Input Delay (FID)

- How responsive the page is to user input
- Target: < 100 milliseconds

### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

- Visual stability of the page
- Target: < 0.1

## Performance Optimization Tips

### 1. Code Splitting

Lazy load code that isn't needed immediately:

```javascript
const Module = lazy(() => import("./HeavyComponent"));
```

### 2. Image Optimization

- Use modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Responsive images with srcset
- Lazy loading for below-the-fold images

### 3. Caching Strategies

- Browser caching for static assets
- Service workers for offline support
- CDN for global distribution

### 4. Bundle Analysis

Monitor your bundle size:

```bash
npm run build -- --analyze
```

## Measuring Performance

Tools you should use:

- **Lighthouse** - Built into Chrome DevTools
- **WebPageTest** - In-depth analysis
- **PageSpeed Insights** - Quick checks
- **Sentry** - Real user monitoring

Performance isn't optional—it's essential!
