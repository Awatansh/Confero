# Understanding Loss Functions

Loss functions are the backbone of machine learning. They measure how well your model is performing and guide the optimization process.

## What is a Loss Function?

A loss function (also called cost function or objective function) is a mathematical function that quantifies the difference between the predicted output and the actual target value.

Loss = f(y, y_predicted)

Where:

- **y** is the true label
- **y_predicted** is the predicted value
- **Loss** is how wrong the prediction is

## Common Loss Functions

### Mean Squared Error (MSE)

The most common loss function for regression:

- MSE = average of (y_i - y_predicted_i)^2
- Penalizes larger errors more heavily
- Good for regression tasks

### Cross-Entropy Loss

Used primarily for classification:

- Measures difference between probability distributions
- Commonly used with neural networks
- Good for classification tasks

## Why Loss Functions Matter

1. **Optimization guidance** - The loss function tells the optimizer which direction to update the weights
2. **Model evaluation** - It measures how well the model generalizes
3. **Training dynamics** - Different loss functions lead to different training behaviors

## Choosing the Right Loss Function

- **Regression**: MSE, MAE, Huber
- **Binary Classification**: Binary Cross-Entropy
- **Multi-class Classification**: Categorical Cross-Entropy
- **Imbalanced Data**: Focal Loss, Weighted Cross-Entropy

The choice of loss function can significantly impact your model's performance!
